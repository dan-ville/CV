      <p>Learning to program means I will be able to do what I want with technology. I will be able to use technology to do tons of things that can make life easier, cooler, and more amazing for me and potentially for others as well.

I want to create things that will facilitate life, especially for the Kingdom of God.</p>

      <p>I believe I will be able to do professional work or freelance work to boost my career and provide for myself and my family. I hope to be good enough to work at a top technology like Airtable, Google, Facebook, Zapier, etc.</p>
